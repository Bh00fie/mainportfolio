# Welcome to My Personal Portfolio!

Hey there! Welcome to my personal portfolio, where I showcase my journey and a collection of projects developed during my exploration of Full Stack Development. The portfolio includes:

- Workout Kitchen: This innovative website uses various APIs to allow users in their quest for recipes and exercises tailored to their preferences. It has proven to be incredibly useful in times when I've forgotten to restock my groceries and find myself limited by the ingredients in my fridge.
- Cover Letter Generator:  As I prepare to enter the job market and apply for graduate positions, this tool becomes invaluable. Crafting cover letters can be time-consuming, which is why I developed a generator that not only saves time but also money. Unlike similar websites that charge around Â£1 per generated cover letter, my solution utilizes the OpenAI API and costs just 0.005$

Feel free to reach out to me if you're intrigued by my profile or would like to offer advice and feedback on enhancing my ongoing projects. You can contact me at abhinandanthour2001@gmail.com. Your input is highly appreciated! ðŸš€
