# Welcome to My Personal Portfolio!

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio where I get to show off who I am and all the cool projects I've been working on while diving into the exciting world of Full Stack Development. Projects such as:
- Workout Kithcen, ever had one of those days when you're staring at a near-empty fridge? Fret not! I built Workout Kitchen, a nifty website that uses different APIs to help you find recipes and exercises based on your cravings. It's been a total lifesaver for me, especially when I'm low on groceries and creativity!
- Cover Letter Generetor, soon I will start applying for graduate position and having a cover letter generator would help me immensly save time and money! Similar website charge you $1 per Cover Letter, this cost me 0.005$ using the OpenAI API!

Please get in touch with me if you're interested in my profile or any advice/feedback on how I can improve my current projects!

Welcome to My Personal Portfolio!
Hey there! Welcome to my personal portfolio, where I showcase my journey and a collection of projects developed during my exploration of Full Stack Development. The portfolio includes:

Workout Kitchen: This innovative website uses various APIs to allow users in their quest for recipes and exercises tailored to their preferences. It has proven to be incredibly useful in times when I've forgotten to restock my groceries and find myself limited by the ingredients in my fridge.

Cover Letter Generator:  As I prepare to enter the job market and apply for graduate positions, this tool becomes invaluable. Crafting cover letters can be time-consuming, which is why I developed a generator that not only saves time but also money. Unlike similar websites that charge around $1 per generated cover letter, my solution utilizes the OpenAI API and costs just 0.005$
